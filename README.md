# Granite, the Goal Reinforcing And Note Improving Tiny Entity

Inspired by the saintly [Gemmy](https://github.com/ericaxu/gemmy), the Obsidian TTRPG Community has taken Gemmy on an adventure through time and space. She's met dragons, owl-bears, robots, aliens and so many interesting beings. Some of them have decided to join her on the quest for the most sarcastic, the most scathing, and sometimes, the most helpful reactions to writing in Obsidian. But she's not alone as her arch-rival, Granite, who also has been gathering friends on own her quest, will stop at nothing to be the most helpful, the most encouraging, and the most annoying of them all.

## Features

### Multiple Characters

-   Gemmy, the original [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md/) Shard who has all new quotes and is now 100% even more unhelpful.
-   Granite, Gemmy's rival in all things. She'll not stop until that purple shard succumbs to the power of her words. (:sparkles: Coming Soon)
-   Drake, the dashing and devious dragon who loves nothing more than to talk about dice. (:sparkles: Coming Soon)

### Random Quotes

Like the original Gemmy, this plugin is based around your "animated pet rock" talking to you, and so it does this on an interval of your choosing within Granite's settings. Sometimes they whisper words of encouragement, and other times they laugh at your writer's block.

### Writing mode

Granite emerges to graciously disrupt your peaceful writing sessions by helpfully pointing out whenever you've dared to pause for an extended duration—because who needs uninterrupted focus, am I right?

By some bizarre twist of fate, using this mode might actually infuse Granite with a rare burst of motivation, urging you to write with unexpected zeal. Please be aware that we cannot be held accountable for any unforeseen surge in productivity that Granite may accidentally induce. Best of luck to your tabletop roleplaying and writing adventures.

## How to Install and Use

To avoid any potential issues, it is advisable not to utilize Granite plugin for work vaults, given its particular language characteristics. It might also roast your coworkers.

It is also not recommended you use this on top of the original Gemmy plugin, as it will cause a conflict.

### Obsidian Community Plugin Browser

Coming Soon to the Obsidian Community Store.
